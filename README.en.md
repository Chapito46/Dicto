# Dicto
[French version](README.md)

Dicto is a dictation application to help students learn spelling
It was first published in the end of 2017, when I was 10 years old
This repo is used as an archive for the project as I lost the source code when I changed my computer
However, the app is still working with a few bugs.

Bugs list:
- The first line of the word list need to be empty, if not, the word will not be in the dictation
- After using the repeat feature, the text zone will not clear the word when it will be corrected

Here is a video of the program working : https://youtu.be/1FGktoWj0J0

WARNING : The program use a specific **FRENCH** vocal synthesis, so the program will not pronounce english word correctly
